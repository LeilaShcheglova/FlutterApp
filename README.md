Name: "FlyStay".
  
The concept behind this application is rather straightforward. It is a mobile application available for both Android and iOS platforms, developed using the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language. The primary purpose of the app is to facilitate the purchase of plane tickets and hotel reservations.

Considerable effort was invested in determining the app's design, with the aid of specialized websites. The color scheme was carefully chosen to have a unisex appeal, catering to the aesthetic preferences of a wide range of users.

Upon successful authorization, the user gains access to four main screens, each serving a distinct purpose.

Starting with the main screen, the app offers a warm welcome to the user, displaying their registered name. Conveniently, the app identifies the user's location and provides real-time weather information. The screen also features a search form.
Just below, in a visually appealing ticket-like design, users can find relevant details about upcoming flights. Furthermore, personalized recommendations for interesting places to visit are provided. Upon selecting one of these recommendations, users are prompted to choose specific dates for ticket selection and subsequently proceed with hotel booking. All functions within the app are customizable to suit individual preferences.

The search page allows users to find round-trip tickets and book hotels. Additionally, a useful information section is available to assist users in preparing for their flights. This section becomes particularly important when traveling with animals, for instance, necessitating adequate preparation.
The ticket page showcases an electronic ticket along with international flight information, including the destination, time, and date. A scannable barcode is also provided, which can be utilized during the boarding process.
The final page within the profile screen displays information about the user's accumulated points and miles. Additionally, a button is available to access further details on how to earn more miles.
